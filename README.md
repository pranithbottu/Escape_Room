# VR_Escape_Room
This contains a side project I did in Unity using C#. I created an escape room in virtual reality successfully.


## Project Overview
My CS 196 escape room project was an opportunity to explore the possibilities in Virtual Reality through the Unity3D engine. We created a pirate ship themed escape room, integrating it into VR. The game can be used with an HTC Vive headset. 


## Current Project Status
I currently have a fully built scene for the player to escape from. There is movement using HTC Vive controllers and interaction with certain objects. These interactions include the ability to pick up objects and sound effects triggered when the player runs into items in the game.


## Future Project Changes
Possible future additions to the game would be more advanced gameplay and puzzles required to escape. Further integration is required to show meaningful messages to the user to help more easily understand the scenario playing out in the game. Finally, there is always the possiblilty of more levels and gameplay that can be added.


## Issues I Faced
* Difficulty with merging Unity files in Github
* Very little starting knowledge of Unity or Virtual Reality
* Limited access to VR equipment until later in the semester
